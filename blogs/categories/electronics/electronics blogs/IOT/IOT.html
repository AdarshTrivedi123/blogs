        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2><br>
        <p>As we all know the internet can be connected to devices like phones, computers, laptops, etc. but in today’s era, we have such a technology that aids in extending this facility of connecting not only digital devices rather almost anything in this world to the internet using unique identifiers (UIDs). That thing that is connected to the internet is what “things” refers to in the “Internet of things”.Theoretically, IoT is defined as “The internet of things, or IoT, is an arrangement of various computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are interrelated and provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and there is an ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.” using the technology of AI algorithm, network and power of data collection IOT enables to make everything smart.</p><br>

        <h2>HOW IoT WORKS?</h2><br>
        <p>An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware to collect, send or act on data they have acquired. IoT devices share the sensor data to the IoT gateway or locally to other devices to act upon that data and take the needful action. Most of this work happens without any human intervention. Humans may interact with devices to set them up or access data from them or give some instruction.</p><br>

        <h2>ADVANTAGES OF IoT</h2><br>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves data collection: With added sensors, it enables the collection of more data which can be used to improve the quality of the services being provided, It also facilitates immediate action on data and hence improves the quality of the result.</li>
                <li>Ability to track and monitor things: IoT enables tracking and monitoring the functioning of various goods or machines. For example, It can help to know whether the machines used in our house in daily life are working properly or not and hence we can take action on replacing or repairing them immediately.</li>
                <li>Improves customer services: Indeed IoT enables the improvement of the quality of products being sold in the market. Also, it allows for improving the customer experience by detecting problems and improving the process.</li>
                <li>Increases efficiency: Suppose IoT enables the manufacturing of such a light bulb which is automatically switched off as soon as you leave the room then this process not only saves time but also saves the cost of electricity.</li>
                <li>Digital transformation: Within an organisation, many different tasks which were earlier supposed to be done physically can now be accomplished digitally. For example, the attendance-taking process can be made simple by using IoT wherein as soon as the person sits in front of their desktop the retina of the employee is detected and a message is sent to the manager about the presence of that particular employee.</li>
            </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h2>DISADVANTAGES OF IoT</h2><br>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The possibility that hackers can steal the information increases as the number of devices among which information is shared increases.</li>
                <li>In order to make a good use of IOT enterprises may have to deal with a myriads of IOT devices which makes the process challenging as the information has to be collected and managed for millions of such devices.</li>
                <li>Every device is prone to get corrupted if there is bug in a single device of the network.</li>
            </ul>
