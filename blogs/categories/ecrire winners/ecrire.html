        <h2>#1 INTERNET OF THINGS</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="blogimg">

        <p>IoT stands for Internet of Things as the name is clearly speaking is just a network of physical objects(things) that are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the aim of connecting and enhancing information with different devices over the web. IoT devices include sensors, software, actuators and other computer devices. IoT works by collecting high volume machine generated data from a variety of sensors to support real time operations.</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>Brief History:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>In the twentieth century computer and our daily use gadgets were brain without senses. They can do things for us but they only know what we told them. But in the present scenario we have developed a network in which our devices can sense and act just like us. They are ready to take decision and work on a task with just a tap on our phone. The word "IoT" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 during his work at Procter&Gamble. The term IoT did not accelerate until 2011 but reached mass market in late 2013.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Technology in IoT:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Don't confuse IOT with other technologies like M2M, Industrial Internet, Web of things, Internet of everything, Industry 4.0 or just internet. loT has a wider context from these technologies and has greater scope. The APN protocol <b>IPv6</b> that we are using today is a network layer protocol that is central to IoT and was launched publicly in 2011. Since then interconnected devices have become commonplace in our everyday lives. With the advent of IoT most of the daily life appliances can be connected with internet and sensors. We can connect the light, fan, doors, windows and much of our room to our phone. Just with a tap we can open them or close. We all might have been scolded by our mothers for refrigerator door not closed properly but with IoT we will simply get a notification on our smart phones that door is open. All the things that we usually forget will be reminded just by notifications. If fuel is low in our vehicle, if smoke chimney is not working, if geyser is ready, if water tank is empty and various other daily life applications will be controlled by IoT. Let's see such apps that can be very useful for us:</p><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="IOT_2/1.png" alt="iot poster">
        </div>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li><b>DASH-</b> Android and ios app that keeps you informed about your car current status and maintenance needs.</li>
            <li><b>ZUBIE-</b> Offer real time GPS fleet tracking while mentoring vehicle health and driver performance.</li>
            <li><b>INSTEON-</b> Controls lighting appliances and also monitors water leaks, smoke and windows and door.</li>
            <li><b>EYELOCK-</b> Iris(eyes) based identity authentication technology.</li>
            <li><b>AT HOME SOLUTIONS-</b> It provide home security, smart lighting and also climate control products</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p><i><b>And many more but we can also work on these topics by writing codes and programming using Micontroller, Arduino and other hardwares.</b></i></p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Introduction to Arduino:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. By using arduino boards and programming skills we can simply connect devices with IoT technology. The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) is used to write code. This code can be uploaded on any arduino board. The boards can be programmed using C and C++ language using a standard API which is known as the arduino language.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Future and Market share:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>In near future IoT manufacturers will focus on designing industry oriented projects rather than general needs. The global remote monitoring market is expected to reach $1386.06 billion by 2026, according to Grand view Research. 26% of the market share in IoT globally is by smart cities. Following it industries are also dedicated to IoT making a share of 24%. The rest 50% is shared by smart homes, smart cars and other utilities.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Security will remain a dead end:</b></h3><br>
        <p>Despite the efforts of government to strengthen IoT security regulators and improve security level mechanisms and data security but privacy problems will never diminish. Cybercriminals use more and more sophisticated practices in order to enroot in connected devices, thereby gaining access to private information. IoT security is the leading barrier to widespread IoT adaption.</p><br>
        
        <p><i>"Some people think we have already learned how to make systems completely secure, and that the IoT can avoid the issues that plague the internet today. But this optimism is unwarranted and even dangerous in how it creates complacency. The real takeaway here is that attacks are inevitable. In 10-15 years, expect IoT security to remain an essential part of this conversation."</i><br>

        <h3><b>IoT in Blockchain:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>The combination of IoT and blockchain offers various benefits and allows a smart device to function itself without the need of a centralized network. It can also track how devices communicate with each other, thereby increasing security levels in blockchain. IoT-blockchain technology is in its initial stages and a fewer companies like IBM have begun to seek opportunities in this space. Key benefits of using blockchain for IoT is building trust, reduce costs and accelerating transactions.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Final thoughts:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Outlining the past, present and future of IoT we've come to the conclusion that interconnected technology is on the path of development despite of cybersecurity challenges. It is guaranteed that it will evolve in the coming years making mankind more lazy. The way we are living life now will be changed to a great extent.</p><br>

        <h2>#2 LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="blogimg">
        <img src="Linguistic_55/1.jpg" alt="linguistics poster">
    </div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
        <p>We perceive the world around us through our senses and frame thoughts constructed on the stimuli we receive from them. It has long been speculated that our thoughts are universalized and indifferent to the language, culture and environment around us. This has drove the fascination of eminent neuroscientists, psychologists, linguists and philosophers for ages and has galvanised them to delve deep into this mystifying domain. With the advancement in technology and cutting-edge research in psycholinguistic studies, we have foregathered some conclusive results that are indicative of how language alters the way we think. In this blog we will peruse some of the psycho physical evidences and pragmatize the theory of linguistic relativity(how thoughts vary with languages). We will also acknowledge the essentiality of preserving linguistic diversity and thereby our culture.</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>Is language merely an instrument of expression?</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>It has been contested that words are just labels for objects and different languages just assign different sounds and structures to things and concepts. On a contrary the “Whorfian hypothesis of language” presents that the language we speak affects our thought process and even the way we perceive and structure the world around us. Nonetheless, recent experiments have proposed that various cultures and languages, steer an individual's attention towards certain aspects(like colour, attributes and gender) relative to the others. Let me relate a few instances to substantiate the claims of the theory.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Languages and Gestures:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>In English and Swedish language, “future is ahead” concept is employed which means that they see future in front of them and past behind them(that's the reason English speakers say we are looking to good times ahead!). Conversely, the speakers of Aymara(spoken in Peru) exercise the “future is behind” concept(They refer the next week as 'back week'). Consequently, English speakers make forward gestures when talking about future while Aymara speakers' gesture towards their back for the same. These gestures are emanated from the thoughts generated in their brains. This observation directs us to the fact that using different languages produced different thoughts and thus different gestures. This reflects how language affects our behaviours.</p><br><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="Linguistic_55/2.jpg" alt="linguistics poster">
        </div>
        <h3><b>Language and Counting:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Certain languages do not have words for some numbers. Subsequently, their speakers find it difficult to count and are impaired from the abilities in arithmetic, algebra and related domains. This reflects that their perception of numbers is less developed than others because of their language.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Language and Colour perception:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>It has been observed that the languages command one's colour recognition ability to an appreciable extent. Russian speakers employ two words (Guluboy and Siniy) for different shades of blue while English speakers have just one. In an experiment the shades of the blue were gradually changed from light to dark and different language speakers were made to observe them. The brains of Russian speakers sparked a stimulus as the colour changed between the words employed for different shades of blue while English speakers did not show any such phenomenon. This observation complimentsthe proposed theory.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Language and Attributes:</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>German and Spanish associate gender with nouns. German grammar attributes bridge as feminine while Spanish characterises it as masculine. When German speakers talk about abridge, they use stereotypically feminine words like beautiful, elegant while Spanish speakers use masculine words like strong, long etc. This leads us to believe that a language's grammar propels its speakers to think about an object a certain way.</p><br>
        <p>These evidences validate and corroborate the |"Whorfian theory of language" that language has deep underlying connections with our thoughts and thus our perception.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Multilingualism and the vantage point</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>As we witnessed above the connections of language and thoughts, we can turn this knowledge in our favour through multilingualism. We get a completely new way of looking at world through the secondary language. Learning language as an adult generally involves only one hemisphere of brain (majorly left) and the speaker tends to think in a rational way in the second language (believe me this works wonders!) Here are some other benefits of multilingualism:</p><br>
        
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Multilingualism delays the onset of diseases like dementia and Alzheimer by 5 years.</li>
            <li>Efforts and attention needed to switch between languages triggers more activity and potentially strengthens the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex which guides the executive functions like problem solving, switching between tasks and attention to tasks.</li>
            <li>It lets you experience differentcultures and their literature.</li>
            <li>It rewires the brain and helps improve memory and function.</li>
            <li>You can watch Netflix without subtitles! (sounds whimsical yet true).</li>
        </ul><br><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="Linguistic_55/3.jpg" alt="linguistics poster">
        </div>
        <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>I hope you were able to witness the ubiquitous nature of language and the way it designs our imagination. There are about 7000 languages across the world (indeed huge!) and each bestows a distinct perspective to the world. They have deep intricacies with culture and an individual's identity. Regrettably we are losing them at an alarming pace. Languages are not just stacks of grammar, they provide different dimensions to the world. We need to understand the gravity of situation and uphold our language high. This can be instrumental in defining ourselves and the human race as a whole.</p><br>

        <h2>#3 ON SUNDAY NIGHT</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="blogimg">

    </div>
    <div class="blogcontent">
        <p>On Sunday night when I was having a movie night with my family,</p><br>

        <p>I was watching the movie Mission Mangal first time after it releases, which is an inspirational story of a group of scientists who work relentlessly to make the Mars Orbiter Mission successful.</p><br>
        
        <p>>Here I saw that that they constructed the spacecraft from a fabric that has the ability to self repair automatically inspite of high temperature of the Sun in the Solar System. From there, I got curious to know more about this kind of fabrics, how they are prepared, how fabrics are turned into sensors and what is the science behind such a technology. There is a whole array of possibilities related to material innovation, smart and sustainable textiles, and the latest processing technologies for the fashion technology. So let's explore about such type of technology:</p><br>
        
        <p><b>What exactly are smart fabrics or smart textiles?</b></p><br>
        
        <p>To understand this term in a simplest way, we define it as textile that has been developed with new technologies that provide added value to the wear, that can sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli from mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical or magnetic properties.</p><br>
        
        <p>Just imagine how wonderful is it to charge your phone from your T-Shirt or a textile which can create energy! Or telling your outfit that you are feeling too hot or cold…and then they responds by cooling or heating itself automatically. These are all within the realm of possibility with the development of Smart Fabrics. 21^st^ century is the period of technological revolution and with the smart textile innovations many value additions can be made to a normal piece of textile material. There is a huge buzz around the business of smart fabric products.</p><br>
        
        <p>Smart textiles are also known as electronic textiles or e-textiles. Their main motive is basically to provide added value to the user, whether for pleasure, performance, safety, security or lifestyle monitoring.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2><b>Classification of Smart Textile</b></h2><br>
        
        <p>There are various classifications available theoretically however the two main broad categories are: aesthetics and performance enhancement.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>1. Aesthetic Smart Textiles</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>These are the textiles that use the technology mainly for the fashion and entertainment purposes, these smart textiles incorporate unique aesthetics into their creation from changing colors to communicating with wearable devices through clothing. Even in the mega events across worldwide like the New York Fashion Week, models controlled what their dresses looked like on the red carpet through their mobile phones!</p><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="SundayNight_6/1.png" alt="linguistics poster">
        </div>
        <h3><b>2. Performance Enhancing Textiles</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>As the name suggests itself, these textiles enhance the performance by regulating body temperature, reducing wind resistance, monitoring heart rate, breath rate and by controlling muscle vibrations. The advent of this revolution provided a great boost to the athletics, sports, military industries and healthcare sectors.</p><br><br>
        
        <h2><b>Application of Smart Textiles</b></h2><br>
        <h3><b>Health</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>There are wireless-enabled garment with embedded textile sensors that allow physiological signals to be continuously monitored during normal daily life activities. These wearable sensitized garments can continuously monitor ECG, human heart rhythm and respiration, and other physical activities. There are smart socks, smart baby jumpsuits and other similar smart clothing used for medical purposes.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Fashion and entertainment</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Because of the recent advancements in fashion technology and wearable gadgets, smart clothing, wearable spaces, multi-functional designs and responsive sportswear has seen significant development in recent years.</p><br>
        
        <p>While technology may be hidden through invisible coatings and advanced fibres, these can be used to dramatically change the appearance of the textile by emitting light or processing light, giving new and dazzling effects. In short, it can make you a Chameleon!</p><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="SundayNight_6/4.png" alt="linguistics poster">
        </div>
        <h3><b>Life jacket and life belt</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>Life jacket is an intelligent medical device that reads the blood pressure or monitors the heart rate of the patients wearing it; the information is then transferred to a computer and read by the medical staff. In a similar way, life belt is a trans-abdominal wearable device that facilitates the parental monitoring procedures for both the mother and the fetus. It can access patients' medical data at any time and can evaluate automated preliminary diagnosis of their condition base on collected data.</p><br>
        
        <h3><b>Sports and fitness</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>For sports and fitness, it is convenient for users to check their exercise time, intensity, distance, energy consumption, breathing, body temperature and other physiological parameters.</p><br>
        
        <p><b>There are three components that must be present in smart textiles, these are sensors, actuators and controlling units. These components interact with one another accordingly with the stimuli in their environment.</b> These smart cloths are created by modified textile material and miniaturized electronic devices. These clothes look like the ordinary cloth but they have the ability to provide special function in various situations according to the design and applications.</p><br><br>
        
        <p style="background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now coming to the self-repairing material that we see in the movie <br>“Mission Mangal”</p><br>
        <div class="blogimg">
            <img src="SundayNight_6/5.png" alt="linguistics poster">
        </div>
        <p>What they actually used was <b>the wolverine cloth,</b> ocean plastic and gold foil with the raw material that was brought from the different parts of India. Now, what is this wolverine cloth and what was its significance in Mars Mission?</p><br>
        
        <p>Wolverine is a self-repairing, mechanically stretchable, conductive and transparent material that can be electrically activated to power artificial muscles, to improve the lifespan of batteries, electronic devices and to develop self-repairing robots. These materials can self-repair by stitching back together. This clothing line uses special fabric which has self-coating, it reacts to heat and friction and reconnect the punctured hole. These materials has many interesting properties like iron conductivity and at the same time they can stretch 50 times its original length, they possess the ability of self-repairing at the room temperature. The material is inspired by the regenerative ability of the comic book villain Wolverine.</p><br>
        
        <p>In this age of smart fabrics, such a technology of self-healing or the automatic repairing gave rise to the innovative ideas in the field of smart textiles currently all over the world. Thus, smart textiles have a wide range of applications that has made our lives far easier and comfortable.</p><br>
